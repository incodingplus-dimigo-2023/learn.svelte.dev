title: Hello World Svelte
---

안녕하세요, 인코딩 플러스 여러분. 여러분은 이제부터 **Svelte**라는 **프론트엔드 웹프레임워크**를 배울 것입니다.

Svelte는 HTML과 CSS의 부족한 생산성을 줄여주는 프레임워크로써, 여러분이 큰 프로젝트를 만들 때 아주 유용할 것입니다.

- [API docs](https://svelte.dev/docs)
- [examples](https://svelte.dev/examples)

간단한 Svelte 프로젝트를 만드려면 `npm init svelte` 또는 `npm create svelte@latest`라고 터미널에 입력하면 됩니다.



## Svelte란?

Svelte는 

Svelte is a tool for building web applications. Like other user interface frameworks, it allows you to build your app _declaratively_ out of components that combine markup, styles and behaviours.

These components are _compiled_ into small, efficient JavaScript modules that eliminate overhead traditionally associated with UI frameworks.

You can build your entire app with Svelte (for example, using an application framework like [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)), or you can add it incrementally to an existing codebase. You can also ship components as standalone packages that work anywhere.

## How to use this tutorial

> You'll need to have basic familiarity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to understand Svelte.

This tutorial is split into four main parts:

- [Welcome to Svelte](/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte) (you are here)
- [Introduction to SvelteKit](/tutorial/introducing-sveltekit)
- [Advanced Svelte](/tutorial/tweens)
- [Advanced SvelteKit](/tutorial/optional-params)

Each section will present an exercise designed to illustrate a feature. Later exercises build on the knowledge gained in earlier ones, so it's recommended that you go from start to finish. If necessary, you can navigate via the menu above.

If you get stuck, you can click the `solve` button to the left of the editor. (It's disabled on sections like this one that don't include an exercise.) Try not to rely on it too much; you will learn faster by figuring out where to put each suggested code block and manually typing it in to the editor.
